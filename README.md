# PictureRenamer

## Introduction

Some cameras generate very generic names for the pictures taken such as DSC_001, which makes it hard to organise your files later on. This application renames picture files (.jpg, .jpeg and .png) to the date they were actually taken.

## How To Use

Simply run the application and choose a folder which contains pictures that you want to rename by clicking "Choose" button. Click "Start" button to initiate renaming process. You can cancel anytime by clicking "Cancel" button.

## Example

For example, if there was a picture called DSC_001, with "Date Taken" property available, after renaming the picture file name will look something like this: 2016-06-18 19_12_25
